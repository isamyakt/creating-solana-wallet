# creating-solana-wallet

-> index.js
I'm creating wallet address like public and private keys using npm package manager called @solana/web3.js and I had fun as I created a wallet address, airdrop some SOL, and make sure the balance is updated

-> sns.js
Just like web3.js has libraries, classes, and functions for us to explore, so does the @solana/spl-name-service module. Solana Name Service (SNS) works similar to DNS, SNS stores wallet addressed using domain name ".sol". In this sns.js file, we can retrieve wallet address from "domain.sol" where domain is name.
