# creating-solana-wallet

- [x] [solana wallet address](./index.js)
I'm creating wallet address like public and private keys using npm package manager called @solana/web3.js and I had fun as I created a wallet address, airdrop some SOL, and make sure the balance is updated

- [x] [Solana Name Service](./sns.js)
Just like web3.js has libraries, classes, and functions for us to explore, so does the @solana/spl-name-service module. Solana Name Service (SNS) works similar to DNS, SNS stores wallet addressed using domain name ".sol". In this sns.js file, we can retrieve wallet address from "domain.sol" where domain is name.

- [x] [Retriving Tokens and Balances](./getTokens.js)
In this javascript code, we'll get to know the token addresses of user or owner holding tokens and even we get to know how much balance the owner is holding for each token.

- [x] [Transactions on Solana](./sendTransactions.js)
Creating a Solana transaction object, and then sending that transaction object to the blockchain
